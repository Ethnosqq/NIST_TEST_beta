NIST Randomness Test Suite Enhancement Project
Project Overview
The goal of this project was to expand the functionality of the existing NIST randomness test suite, enabling it to handle multiple files and create a standalone executable application for ease of use.

Key Features
Code Enhancements
Multiple File Processing: Updated the execute method to support processing of multiple input files simultaneously.
Data Handling: Ensured correct processing and cleaning of data from various file types, with improved support for different formats.
File Management
Interactive File Selection: Implemented functionality for users to select and process multiple binary and string-based files interactively.
Optimized Data Aggregation: Improved file reading algorithms and added error handling to ensure smooth performance.
User Interface Improvements
Enhanced GUI: Developed a more intuitive interface, allowing users to easily select multiple files, view test results, and manage processes.
Standalone Application
Executable Creation: Configured the project using PyInstaller to create an independent executable file (main.exe), including all necessary dependencies for cross-platform functionality.
Documentation and Collaboration
Provided detailed documentation of code changes and functionality enhancements.
Collaborated with the team to test and validate the improved functionality, ensuring high stability and user satisfaction.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
GUI Framework: Tkinter
Executable Packaging: PyInstaller
Statistical Libraries: NumPy, SciPy
Resource Management: Importlib Resources
Conclusion
The NIST randomness test suite now supports multiple file processing and has an enhanced user interface, making it easier and more functional. The project resulted in a more powerful and user-friendly tool, packaged as a standalone executable application.
